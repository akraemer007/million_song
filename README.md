  * Appropriate scope
  * Does it have the appropriate level of difficulty for a two week problem
  * Does the student have suitable data to answer their question?  If not, can they obtain this data?
  * If the problem could not be solved with ‘ideal’ data, it should be rejected
* Data:

* Model (20/100) - If model is used
